## Problem

`InputReference` variants cannot use `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]` due to a serde limitation: internally-tagged enum dispatch replays the tag field into the inner struct's deserializer, making `deny_unknown_fields` incompatible. The result: a caller who passes a reference with a mistyped field (e.g., `publischer` instead of `publisher`) gets no error — the field is silently ignored, the output is wrong, and there is no diagnostic.

This is the one gap in our "strict validation" design principle. Documented in DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md §3.

## Why it matters before spec stabilization

Once the schema is declared stable, callers (Zotero, Pandoc, etc.) will rely on the current behavior as the contract. Mitigation is much cheaper before adoption than after.

## Options

1. **Post-deserialize validation pass** — after deserializing an `InputReference`, check for `None` on fields expected for that reference type (e.g., `publisher` for `book`). Surface a structured warning or error. Low complexity; fits the `citum check` validation pattern.

2. **Custom `Deserialize` impl** — replicate `deny_unknown_fields` behavior via a manual deserializer on the enum. High complexity; tight coupling to serde internals.

3. **Accept + expose via `citum check`** — document it clearly, add an explicit validation path users can run to catch mistyped fields. Least invasive; fits "processor stays dumb, caller validates explicitly" ethos.

**Recommendation:** Option 3 for immediate stabilization; Option 1 as follow-up for richer diagnostics.

## Summary of Changes

Resolved via Option 3 (accept + document). The trade-off is documented in DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md §3 and the code comment at reference/types.rs:93 and :140 explains the serde limitation. No behavioral mitigation was added pre-stabilization — the explicit validation path via `citum check` is the recommended approach for callers. Bean body's own recommendation was Option 3; that is the current state.
