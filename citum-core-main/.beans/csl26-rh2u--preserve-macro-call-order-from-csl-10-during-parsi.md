Problem: CSLN renders components in wrong order compared to CSL 1.0. Oracle shows contributors → year → title but CSLN renders title → contributors → year.

Investigation revealed this is a symptom of a broader architectural issue with the XML semantic compiler approach. The template compiler has hit a wall: 0% bibliography match across ALL top parent styles despite 87-100% citation match.

Failed approach: Built source_order infrastructure that tracked depth-first traversal order, but assigned wrong orders (title=0 when it should be last). Reverted in commit 1c9ad45.

Root cause: Fundamental model mismatch between CSL 1.0 (procedural: macros, choose/if/else, groups with implicit suppression) and CSLN (declarative: flat templates with typed overrides). The XML compiler excels at options extraction but fails at template structure.

**Resolution: See docs/architecture/MIGRATION_STRATEGY_ANALYSIS.md for full analysis and recommended hybrid approach.**

This bean is blocked by implementation of the hybrid migration strategy (csl26-hybrid milestone).

## Status Note (2026-02-27)

This bean remains canceled and is now treated as superseded by subsequent implementation work.

- Current baseline no longer matches the original failure claim:
  - `node scripts/oracle-batch-aggregate.js styles-legacy/ --top 10` reports bibliography 100% for `7/10` styles.
- Macro-order preservation is now implemented in the template compiler merge path via `source_order` sorting.
- Remaining bibliography deltas should be tracked under `csl26-ifiw` using concrete style-level failures (e.g., `publisher:extra`) rather than re-opening this broad ordering bean.
