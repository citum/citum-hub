Templates have components in wrong sequence vs CSL 1.0 output (51 ordering issues across 10 styles). Example: pages appearing before containerTitle instead of after. Root cause is in csln_migrate/src/template_compiler/ where CSL 1.0 layouts are converted to CSLN templates. Need to preserve CSL 1.0 layout order during migration.
