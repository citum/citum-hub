Ensure the processor supports automatic foot/endnoting to enable seamless style switching between in-text and note styles.

Requirements:
- Citations in manually-placed foot/endnotes (position doesn't change)
- Automatically created footnotes (tool creates/removes notes based on style)
- Corner cases around surrounding punctuation
- Must work in both batch (Pandoc) and interactive (Word/Zotero) workflows

Reference implementations:
- Zotero/citeproc-js
- org-cite oc-csl.el
- biblatex's `\autocite` command

Impact: Note styles (19% of corpus)
Effort: 2-3 weeks
