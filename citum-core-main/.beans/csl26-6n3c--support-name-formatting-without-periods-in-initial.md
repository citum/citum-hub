Some styles want initials without periods.

Current: Kuhn, T. S. (with periods)
Expected: Kuhn TS (no periods)

Fix:
- Handle initialize-with='' (no period after initials)
- Handle initialize-with=' ' (space only)
- Distinguish from initialize-with='.'
- Update name rendering in citum_engine
- Test against styles using no-period format
