Epic tracking the phased reorganization of this workspace into the Citum
ecosystem: cleaner crate boundaries, GitHub org rename, and a public
bindings strategy.

See docs/architecture/CITUM_MODULARIZATION.md for the full plan.

## Phase 0 (completed)
- csl26-p0cl: Remove unused clap dep from citum_engine ✅
- csl26-p0dc: Decouple citum_schema from csl_legacy and biblatex ✅

## Phase 1 (at next wave break)
- csl26-p1rn: GitHub org transfer + crate rename

## Phase 2 (pre-production)
- csl26-p2bn: Define citum-bindings public API
- csl26-p2lb: Create citum/labs repository with LuaLaTeX binding
