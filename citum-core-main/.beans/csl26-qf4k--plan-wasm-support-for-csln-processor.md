Research and design WASM integration strategy for citum_engine to enable browser-based citation processing.

Goals:
- Compile citum_engine to WebAssembly target (wasm32-unknown-unknown)
- Design JavaScript/TypeScript bindings for browser usage
- Evaluate wasm-bindgen vs other approaches
- Consider bundle size optimization strategies
- Plan for async/sync API variants
- Design pluggable renderer integration for HTML output

References:
- citeproc-rs WASM implementation patterns (docs/architecture/PRIOR_ART.md)
- Issue #105: Pluggable output formats
- Web-based style editor requirements (STYLE_EDITOR_VISION.md)

Deliverables:
- Architecture document for WASM integration
- Proof-of-concept WASM build configuration
- Performance comparison (native vs WASM)
- API design for JavaScript consumers
