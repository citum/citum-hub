The prototype WinnowCitationParser for Djot supports basic locator labels (p, ch, vol, etc.), but needs to be more robust.

Next steps:
- Expand the list of supported locator labels (see CSL 1.0 locator list).
- Implement normalization of locator forms (e.g., "page 10" -> page: 10).
- Support range parsing in locators (e.g., "pp. 10-12").
- Support multiple items with locators in single citation groups.
- Investigate locale-aware locator label detection.

Impact: Essential for scholarly citation fidelity.
