Create a `citum/labs` GitHub repository to house proof-of-concept
integrations and experimental bindings that use citum-core.

## Initial Contents

* Move `bindings/lua/` (LuaLaTeX integration) as the first experiment
  from `citum/citum-core` into `citum/labs`
* Document clearly as non-stable / proof-of-concept
* Establish the pattern for future experimental integrations (WASM, etc.)

## Guidelines for Labs

* No stability guarantees
* Each experiment is a standalone directory with its own README
* Experiments graduate to `citum-bindings` only when API is stable
