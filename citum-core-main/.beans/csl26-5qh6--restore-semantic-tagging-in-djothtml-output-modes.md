The introduction of list/group rendering using PlainText internally caused Djot and HTML output modes to lose semantic tagging for authors and issued dates. A generic refactor of ProcTemplateComponent or a TargetFormat-aware rendering pipeline is needed to fix this correctly without massive code duplication.
