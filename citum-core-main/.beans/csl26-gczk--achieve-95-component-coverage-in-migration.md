Track and ensure comprehensive CSL 1.0 element coverage.

Goals:
- Identify CSL 1.0 elements not yet migrated
- Add missing CSLN component types where needed
- Verify no silent data loss during migration
- Document unsupported elements with workarounds

Verification:
- Run citum_analyze across all 2,844 styles
- Log unmapped CSL elements
- Add coverage metrics to migration output

Impact: Prevents silent feature loss

## Progress (2026-02-27)

- Added component coverage threshold reporting (`--component-threshold`, default `0.95`) to migration gap analysis.
- Added failure listing for styles under threshold.
- Added aggregated unmapped component reporting from oracle component diffs.
- Added execution runbook: `docs/architecture/CSL26_GCZK_COMPONENT_COVERAGE_PLAN_2026-02-27.md`.

## Summary of Changes\n\n--component-threshold flag implemented in analyze-migration-gaps.js. Verified 2026-02-27.
