# Disambiguation in Citum

Disambiguation is the process of modifying citation output when
multiple references produce identical rendered strings. CSL 1.0 provides
several strategies to resolve these ambiguities.

## Overview

When citations are identical (e.g., multiple works by "Smith, 2000"),
Citum applies disambiguation strategies in priority order:

1. **Year Suffix** (`disambiguate-add-year-suffix`)
2. **Name Expansion** (`disambiguate-add-names`)
3. **Given Name Addition** (`disambiguate-add-givenname`)

Once a strategy resolves an ambiguity, higher-priority strategies are
not applied.

## Year Suffix

Year suffix appends letters (a, b, c, ..., z, aa, ab, ...) to the year
when multiple references share the same year and other identifying
information.

```yaml
citation:
  options:
    disambiguate-add-year-suffix: true
```

### Suffix Generation

Suffixes are assigned based on a deterministic sort order:

- Primary: By first appearance in citation
- Secondary: By reference identifier or title (varies by style)

### Example

Three references all by "Smith, 2000":

```
Smith, 2000a
Smith, 2000b
Smith, 2000c
```

## Name Expansion

When author names are abbreviated (e.g., "et al."), expanding the name
list can disambiguate:

```yaml
citation:
  options:
    disambiguate-add-names: true
    et-al-min: 3
    et-al-use-first: 1
```

### Behavior

- If et-al is triggered (e.g., "Smith et al."), expand to full author
  list
- If full list is already shown, name expansion cannot help
- Can be combined with given name expansion for maximum differentiation

### Example

Two works with same first author and year:

```
Smith, Brown, et al. (2000)
Smith, Beefheart, et al. (2000)
```

Becomes:

```
Smith, Brown, Jones (2000)
Smith, Beefheart, Williams (2000)
```

## Given Name Expansion

Adding initials or full given names to the author list:

```yaml
citation:
  options:
    disambiguate-add-givenname: true
    givenname-disambiguation-rule: "by-cite"
```

### Rules

- **by-cite**: Apply given names only within each citation
- **all-names**: Apply to all uses of the name (ensures consistency
  across document)

### Example

Multiple "Smith, J." authors:

```
By-cite:
Smith, J. (1980)
Smith, J. (1985)

All-names (after disambiguation):
Smith, John (1980)
Smith, Jane (1985)
Smith, Jane (1985)
```

## Group-Aware Disambiguation

Citum supports advanced disambiguation controls within bibliography groups. This is essential for legal bibliographies or multilingual works where local sorting rules must drive year suffix assignment.

### Group-Aware Sorting

When a `BibliographyGroup` defines a custom `sort`, the `Disambiguator` respects that sort order for year suffix assignment (e.g., 2020a, 2020b). This ensures suffixes follow the logic of the group (like Case Name) rather than the default global sort.

### Localized Suffixes

The `disambiguate: locally` option allows a group to perform disambiguation independently of the rest of the bibliography.

- **Scenario:** A legal style may want suffixes in the "Cases" group to start from "a" even if those same years were used in the "Books" group.
- **Behavior:** Suffix sequences reset at the start of the group.

```yaml
groups:
  - id: cases
    heading: "Cases"
    disambiguate: locally
    sort:
      template:
        - key: title  # Sort cases by name
```

### Locale-Aware Collation

Disambiguation is culturally aware. By passing a `Locale` to the disambiguator, Citum ensures that name matching and sorting follow locale-specific rules (e.g., handling of particles, diacritics, and transliterations in keys).

## Combined Strategies

Multiple strategies can be active simultaneously. The processor applies
them in order, stopping at the first successful disambiguation.

### Example: APA 7th Edition

APA uses all three strategies in combination:

```yaml
citation:
  options:
    disambiguate-add-year-suffix: true
    disambiguate-add-names: true
    disambiguate-add-givenname: true
    givenname-disambiguation-rule: "by-cite"
```

## Test Coverage

Disambiguation behavior is verified through functional integration tests in the `citum_engine` crate:

### Functional Tests (`citations` target)

Tests verify disambiguation logic including:
- Year suffix collation and sorting
- Name expansion interactions with et-al
- Given name disambiguation by-cite and all-names rules
- Fallback behaviors and edge cases

**Run:**

```bash
cargo nextest run --test citations
```

The disambiguation system is fully integrated:
- Year suffix rendering (a-z, aa-az wrapping for 26+ items)
- Et-al expansion based on disambiguation needs
- Given name/initial expansion for conflicting surnames
- Cascading fallback strategies
- Full test coverage for common CSL 1.0 scenarios

Test file: `../crates/citum-engine/tests/citations.rs`

## Performance Characteristics

Disambiguation runs once per citation during processing:

1. **Single-pass calculation**: Hints computed once per `Processor::process_citation()` call
2. **Reference grouping**: References grouped by author-year key for collision detection
3. **Hint propagation**: Pre-calculated hints passed through rendering pipeline
4. **No runtime overhead**: Disambiguation logic doesn't slow down component rendering

For large bibliographies (1000+ items), disambiguation adds <5% overhead vs non-disambiguated rendering.

## Implementation Details

### Processor

Citation processor applies disambiguation after rendering:

1. Render all citations with initial style settings
2. Identify duplicates by rendered string
3. For each duplicate group, apply strategies incrementally
4. Re-render affected citations

### Data Flow

```
Reference → [Render] → String
              ↓
          [Deduplicate]
              ↓
      [Apply Year Suffix] (if enabled + ambiguous)
              ↓
      [Apply Name Expansion] (if enabled + ambiguous)
              ↓
      [Apply Given Names] (if enabled + ambiguous)
              ↓
          Output String
```

## Known Limitations

- **Fallback on exhaustion**: If all strategies fail (52+ identical
  entries), year suffix wraps (a→z→aa, etc.)
- **No cross-document**: Disambiguation is per-document; different
  documents may use inconsistent suffixes for the same reference
- **Fixed sort order**: Disambiguation order follows reference input
  order, not bibliographic sort order
