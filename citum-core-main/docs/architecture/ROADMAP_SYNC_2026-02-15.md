# Roadmap Synchronization - 2026-02-15

> **Historical snapshot**: point-in-time execution record. For current status, use `docs/TIER_STATUS.md` and `docs/architecture/ROADMAP.md`.

**Purpose:** Document the alignment between project reality and tracking systems (beans, docs)
**Note:** This is a historical synchronization snapshot from 2026-02-15. For
current metrics, see `docs/architecture/ROADMAP.md`.

## Changes Made

### 1. Bean Updates

**csl26-o3ek (Top-10 Styles)**
- Status: `todo` → `in-progress`
- Updated conversion status: 10/10 styles converted to YAML
- Added current quality metrics:
  - Citations: 9/10 at 15/15 match (90%, Springer regression tracked)
  - Bibliography: varies by format
    - Author-date: 6-14/15 (APA 14/15, Elsevier Harvard 8/15, Chicago 6/15)
    - Numeric: 0/15 (blocked on year positioning)
- Added phased approach (author-date refinement → numeric features → workflow optimization)

**csl26-m3lb (Hybrid Migration Strategy)**
- Status: `todo` → `in-progress`
- Updated success criteria to reflect achievements:
  - APA bibliography: ✅ 14/15 achieved
  - XML options pipeline: ✅ maintained (~2,500 lines)
  - Citations: ✅ 9/10 at 15/15
- Added latest progress notes (locale infrastructure complete, RoleLabel system)

**csl26-gidg (90% Oracle Match)**
- Updated current status with concrete metrics:
  - Top 10 citations: 9/10 at 15/15 (90%)
  - Top 10 bibliography: 6-14/15 author-date, 0/15 numeric
  - Coverage: 60% dependent corpus (4,792/7,987)
- Added blockers (year positioning, volume/issue, Springer regression)
- Enhanced measurement section with weekly tracking cadence

### 2. New Strategic Document

**../ROADMAP.md** (Created)

Comprehensive roadmap tracking:

**Current State Matrix:**
- Foundation: ✅ Complete (parser, schema, type system, EDTF)
- Migration Pipeline: ✅ Operational (XML options, output-driven templates, LLM authoring)
- Processor: Format-specific (author-date 90% citations, numeric blocked, note not tested)
- Tooling: ✅ Optimized (88% token reduction, workflow scripts, benchmarking)

**Phase Plan:**
- Phase 1: Author-Date Quality Refinement (current, 4 styles, 40% corpus)
- Phase 2: Numeric Style Features (next, 6 styles, 20% corpus)
- Phase 3: Note Styles (deferred, 542 styles, 19% corpus)
- Phase 4: Production Readiness (future, WASM, JSON server, API stability)

**Metrics Dashboard:**
- Top-10 coverage: 10/10 (100%)
- Top-10 citation quality: 9/10 at 15/15 (90%)
- Author-date bib quality: 6-14/15 (varies)
- Numeric bib quality: 0/15 (blocked)
- Dependent corpus: 4,792/7,987 (60%)

**Risk Register:**
- High: Numeric timeline delay, LLM budget overruns, perception gap
- Medium: Workflow optimization transferability, numeric feature complexity

**Workflow Optimization Notes:**
- What works: 5-phase /styleauthor, structured oracle, iterative refinement
- What needs improvement: Numeric support, budget optimization, failure documentation
- Common failure modes: Year positioning, volume/issue, editor labels, page delimiters, DOI suppression

**Decision Log:**
- 2026-02-15: Hybrid migration strategy validated
- 2026-02-08: Defer note styles to Phase 3
- 2026-02-08: Type system architecture finalized

## Verified Completions

The following beans are correctly marked `completed`:
- csl26-k07r (Phase 1: 88% token reduction)
- csl26-dr5x (Phase 2: Cross-tier validation, coverage reports)
- csl26-9sxv (Phase 3: Agent transitions, visual diffs)
- csl26-95qj (Phase 4: Caching, checkpoint/resume)
- csl26-z8rc (Output-driven template inferrer)
- csl26-fccy (Styleauthor agent integration)

## Key Insights from Analysis

### 1. Hybrid Strategy is Validated
APA 7th achieving 14/15 bibliography proves LLM authoring works. The XML options pipeline (87-100% citation accuracy) complements this perfectly. The combination is the breakthrough.

### 2. Numeric Styles are the Critical Path
6/10 top styles are numeric (IEEE, Elsevier With-Titles/Vancouver, AMA, Springer Vancouver/Basic Brackets). All blocked at 0/15 bibliography due to year positioning. This is ~20% of dependent corpus and blocks 60% coverage goal.

### 3. Workflow Optimization is Complete
Phases 1-4 complete with 88% token reduction. The /styleauthor skill is battle-tested. The tooling is solid. Focus can shift to quality refinement and feature implementation.

### 4. Coverage ≠ Quality
Having 10/10 styles converted (60% corpus coverage) is different from having them at production quality. Current range: 6-14/15 bibliography for author-date, 0/15 for numeric. This gap needs transparent communication.

### 5. Repeatability is Unproven
APA 14/15 is a single data point. Elsevier Harvard (8/15) and Chicago (6/15) show variation. Need to test if the workflow scales or if APA success was lucky.

## Next Actions

### Immediate (Bean Maintenance)
- ✅ csl26-o3ek: Updated with conversion status and phased plan
- ✅ csl26-m3lb: Updated with achievement tracking
- ✅ csl26-gidg: Updated with concrete metrics and blockers
- ✅ ../ROADMAP.md: Created strategic tracking document

### Short-Term (Phase 1 Execution)
1. Iterate APA to 15/15 bibliography (currently 14/15)
2. Iterate Elsevier Harvard to 12/15+ (currently 8/15)
3. Iterate Chicago to 10/15+ (currently 6/15)
4. Baseline Springer Basic and iterate to 10/15+
5. Document patterns and failure modes in .claude/skills/styleauthor/LESSONS.md

### Medium-Term (Phase 2 Setup)
1. Fix Springer citation regression (9/10 → 10/10)
2. Implement year positioning feature (unblock numeric styles)
3. Implement citation numbering and superscript
4. Test numeric style iteration with one style (IEEE or Elsevier With-Titles)
